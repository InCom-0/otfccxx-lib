[otfccxx-lib](https://github.com/InCom-0/otfccxx-lib) is a wrapper around (part of) the functionality of [otfcc-lib_cmake](https://github.com/InCom-0/otfcc-lib_cmake), which is itself a forked version of [otfcc](https://github.com/caryll/otfcc).<br><br>

[otfcc-lib_cmake](https://github.com/InCom-0/otfcc-lib_cmake) cleaved off the 'library' portion of the original project, modernized the build system to modern CMake (as of 2025), ensured cross-platform and (all major) modern compiler compatibility.<br><br>

[otfccxx-lib](https://github.com/InCom-0/otfccxx-lib) attempts to provide modern C++ interface focused primarily at 'splicing' OpenType fonts. In other words, 'merging' or 'combining fonts or rather the glyphs or other features within those fonts to produce a new font.
